# Boss Killing First Attempts

As the sun sets on another day in Gielinor, I find myself deep in thought, plotting my next big move in Old School RuneScape. It's been a journey of highs and lows, of triumphs and setbacks. But today, I'm focused on the future, on crafting a master plan that will guide me through the challenges ahead.

## The Master Plan

My journey begins with a focus on agility. I've set my sights on reaching levels 82 and 85, not just for the sake of the levels themselves, but for what they unlock: the ability to don the full black graceful outfit, a symbol of my dedication and hard work. But agility is just the start. My plan encompasses much more, from mastering the Theatre of Blood for its coveted thread to honing my skills in Last Man Standing for practice.

Herblore plays a crucial role in my strategy. I've gathered a plethora of ingredients, ready to be transformed into potions that will aid me in my quest. The dragon pickaxe and, eventually, the dragon axe are also on my list, essential tools for the challenges that lie ahead.

## A New Plan

As days pass, my strategy evolves. The core remains the same: Theatre of Blood, Last Man Standing, but now there's an added focus on thievery. I plan to amass a vast collection of seeds, a crucial resource for my ambitions. Deathbanking, contracts, and relentless agility training until I reach level 85 become my new routine.

## The Direction

My account's future is a tapestry of interconnected paths. Slayer, bossing, mining, woodcutting, and more, each with its own needs and benefits. My ultimate goal? To achieve mastery in each area, unlocking the full potential of my character.

The agility path is clear: from the Hallowed Sepulchre to the rooftops of Fremennik, each step brings me closer to my goal. With each level gained, I burn through my herblore resources, tackle Zulrah for its treasures, and prepare for the challenges that lie in the Wilderness and beyond.

## Realizations and Revelations

In a moment of clarity, I realize I've had the ability to boost for 87 herblore for months. This revelation sets off a chain of events, from crafting antivenoms to completing the Karamja diary, each achievement bringing me closer to my ultimate goal.

I've spent hours at Wintertodt, seeking experience for prayer, only to realize agility is my lowest skill. This distraction, though frustrating, has clarified my path forward. I now know that mastering agility is not just a step in my journeyâ€”it's the foundation upon which all my other goals rest.

## Looking Ahead

As I prepare for another day in Gielinor, I'm reminded of the complexity and depth of Old School RuneScape. My journey is far from over, but with each step, I grow stronger, more skilled, and more determined. The road ahead is long and fraught with challenges, but I am ready. Ready to face whatever comes my way, ready to achieve greatness.

To my fellow adventurers, I say this: the journey may be daunting, but the rewards are unparalleled. Forge your path, set your goals, and never lose sight of what drives you. Together, we will conquer.
