# Agility and Arcana: A Runescaper's Tale

So, there I was, contemplating the vast expanse of Gielinor, when a thought struck me like a bolt from Saradomin himself. Why not just deathbank and dive headfirst into agility training? But wait, what's on the pre-deathbank bucket list? Ah, yes, the elusive 85 Agility and the coveted full Graceful outfit. Straight up, that's a marathon at least 4 to 6 hours away. But who's counting when you're on the brink of greatness?

Full Graceful, you ask? Just a mere 3 hours away. Max effort for maximum reward. Decision made: full Graceful, edge close to 85, then abandon the black Graceful plan. The path was clear.

Then, the grand scheme: finish Graceful, toy with the idea of 85 Agility, deathbank for some laid-back Runecrafting, and finally, Barrows till I'm decked out in a full set. Simple, right?

Yes, indeed. And then, in a moment of unironic ambition, I set my sights on 99 Runecrafting. Why? It's the key to bypassing the need for a wrath talisman or catalytic talisman. A revelation! I can store a wrath talisman. This was huge, a game-changer.

I thought I'd cornered myself without a catalytic talisman, but no, the wrath talisman storage was my salvation. Hell yeah. This just meant I had to gear up for 50 Vorkath at some point. No biggie, right?

All my seeds snug in their seed box, my character was primed for deathbanking. Just had to use up those seeds and give it some thought. Meanwhile, the Monster Hunter builds and shopping list were coming along nicely.

650k XP till 93 Runecrafting. That's roughly 35 hours away. Frankly, I don't need 95 Runecrafting. 92 gives me a solid 40% chance to snag the +3 bonus for wrath runes. But then, disaster struck.

FUCKKKK. DIED. I lost because she kept breaking spellshield and obliterating my guys. Definitely wasn't the god run.

So, after some reflection and a few (dozen) rage quits later, I realized something important. This journey, with its ups and downs, was what playing Oldschool Runescape was all about. The grind, the sudden insights, the unexpected setbacks, and, most importantly, the relentless pursuit of those sweet, sweet gains.

So, here's to agility, arcana, and the never-ending adventure that is OSRS. May the RNG gods ever be in our favor.
