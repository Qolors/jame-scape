# The Ironman PvM Progression Saga

My Ironman account has become an absolute unit, surpassing my main in almost every conceivable way. It's a bit surreal, honestly. The goals I've set for myself are no small feat:

- **5kc in all bosses**
- **Securing meaningful PvM drops**
- **Achieving base 90s or max stats** (depending on how deep into the grind I'm willing to dive into my well of despair)

Currently, I'm navigating the treacherous waters of mid-game, with my sights set on some hefty PvM milestones: Ahrims, the coveted blowpipe, a full barrows set, thread, prims, occult, and those juicy raids drops.

## The Path to Glory

The roadmap to achieving 5kc in all bosses while snagging those meaningful PvM drops is pretty straightforward - a healthy mix of Slayer, bossing, and more bossing. Specifically, I'm looking at more barrows runs, Zulrah, and the Theatre of Blood.

As for the journey to base 90s, it's a bit more nuanced:

- **Combats:** Levelled passively through Slayer and PvM
- **Prayer:** Boosted through various means including moons, Slayer, hunter, and mining
- **Runecrafting (95/99):** A necessary evil for efficient Slayer and Prayer leveling
- **Construction (99):** Essential for that max pool and the outfit
- **Hunter (99):** A leisurely pursuit with benefits for Herblore and Prayer
- **Herblore (90+):** Fueled by farming and PvM drops
- **Crafting, Fletching, Mining, Smithing, Fishing, Cooking:** A mix of necessity and whatever I feel like doing
- **Firemaking:** Wintertodt, because of course
- **Woodcutting:** All about that dragon axe

## Present Day Endeavors

Right now, it's all about hitting those major breakpoints in Herblore and Agility. I'm grinding Zulrah for that elusive magic seed and tackling the Dagganoth Kings for the dragon axe. Once those are in the bag, it's a toss-up between Hunter, Slayer, or the Wilderness bosses for kicks.

With 85 Agility, I'll be zipping through shortcuts to the Dagganoth Kings like it's nothing. Ranking on a couple of boss hiscores is just within reach, not to mention getting closer to completing the hard combat diary.

And here's a kicker - I've had the level to boost for 87 Herblore for the last three months without even realizing it. Just 45k exp away from being able to pie boost for antivenoms. Then it's on to completing the Karamja diary and securing that max pool in the house.

So, whenever I'm done thieving, it's back to the grind. This account's journey is far from over, and I'm here for every step of the way.
