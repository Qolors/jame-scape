# Ironman PvM Progression - A Journey of Goals and Gains

The account is so incredibly good, it's hard to believe. It's surpassed my main in so many areas, and the journey has only just begun. The overarching goals for this account are ambitious yet clear:

- Achieve 5kc (kill count) in all bosses
- Secure meaningful PvM (Player vs Monster) drops
- Reach base 90s or max stats (depending on my level of dedication... or depression)

Currently, I find myself halfway through the mid-game according to the historical Ironman PvM progression guide. My PvM goals are quite specific: Ahrims, blowpipe, a full barrows set, thread, prims, occult, and raid drops. These are the treasures I seek.

## The Path to 5kc in All Bosses and Beyond

The strategy is straightforward yet challenging:

- **Slayer and Bossing**: The dual approach of leveling Slayer while learning and killing bosses is the key to achieving 5kc in all bosses.

- **Pursuing Meaningful PvM Drops**: This involves grinding more barrows, facing Zulrah, continuing with Slayer tasks, and tackling the Theatre of Blood (ToA).

## The Road to Base 90s

The plan for achieving base 90s in all skills is as follows:

- **Combats**: Level up passively through Slayer and PvM activities.
- **Prayer**: Utilize moons, Slayer tasks, hunter activities, and mining.
- **Runecrafting (95/99)**: Essential for efficient Slayer and Prayer leveling.
- **Construction (99)**: Prioritize keeping this above Prayer level and acquire the outfit.
- **Hunter (99)**: Engage in whenever possible, beneficial for Herblore and Prayer.

And the list goes on, covering Herblore, Crafting, Fletching, Mining, Smithing, Fishing, Cooking, Firemaking, and Woodcutting. Each skill has its path, with major nodes being Slayer, Hunter, and acquiring dragon equipment.

## Present Day and Immediate Goals

As of today, the focus is on Herblore and Agility until major breakpoints are reached. The plan includes grinding Zulrah for the magic seed and tackling Dagganoth Kings for the dragon axe. Once these milestones are achieved, the options open up: continue with Hunter until 99 for fun, delve deeper into Slayer, or brave the wilderness for bossing adventures.

The journey is long, filled with challenges and excitement at every turn. Each goal brings me closer to the ultimate Ironman PvM mastery, and I can't wait to see where this path takes me next.
