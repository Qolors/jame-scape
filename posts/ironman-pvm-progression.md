# Ironman PvM Progression - A Journey of Triumphs

My Ironman account has become an unexpected powerhouse, surpassing my main in numerous aspects. The thrill of this progression is something I can hardly contain. My goals are ambitious, yet distinctly clear:

- Achieve 5kc in all bosses
- Secure meaningful PvM drops
- Reach base 90s or max stats, mood dependent

Currently, I find myself in the thick of the mid-game, with my sights set on Ahrims, the blowpipe, a full barrows set, thread, prims, occult, and coveted raids drops. The roadmap to achieving 5kc across all bosses intertwines with my PvM drop aspirations, leading me through a gauntlet of barrows, Zulrah, slayer tasks, and the Theatre of Blood.

## The Path to Base 90s

The journey to base 90s is a multifaceted one, involving:

- **Combat Skills:** A passive grind through slayer and PvM encounters.
- **Prayer:** Leveraged through moons, slayer, hunter, and mining activities.
- **Runecrafting (95/99):** A necessity for efficient slayer and prayer leveling.
- **Construction (99):** To stay ahead of prayer levels and secure the outfit.
- **Hunter (99):** A flexible skill, beneficial for herblore and prayer.
- **Herblore (90+):** Fueled by farming and PvM drops.
- **Crafting (90+):** Though seemingly pointless, it's a glass-burning marathon.
- **Fletching (90+):** A profitable skill, perfect for downtime.
- **Mining:** The quest for the dragon pickaxe.
- **Smithing (90+):** Enhanced through giants foundry and PvM drops.
- **Fishing and Cooking (90+):** A leisurely pursuit.
- **Firemaking:** Conquered at Wintertodt.
- **Woodcutting:** Dominated with the dragon axe.

The major milestones in this journey are slayer, hunter, and acquiring dragon equipment. As of now, I'm focusing on herblore and agility until I hit significant breakpoints. The plan includes farming Zulrah for the magic seed and tackling the Dagganoth Kings for the dragon axe.

Once the major skill breakpoints are reached, the world is my oyster. I could continue to 99 hunter for the sheer enjoyment, delve deeper into slayer, or brave the wilderness for boss encounters. The possibilities are endless, and the excitement is palpable.

This journey is not just about the destination but the incredible experiences along the way. Each boss kill, each level gained, brings with it a sense of achievement and progression that is uniquely satisfying. As I continue on this path, I'm reminded of the sheer depth and complexity of Oldschool Runescape, and why it captures the hearts of so many adventurers.
