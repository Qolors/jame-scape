# The Ironman PvM Progression Saga

In the world of Oldschool Runescape, where every item and achievement is earned through blood, sweat, and the occasional tears, my Ironman account stands as a testament to dedication and perhaps a sprinkle of madness. This account, surpassing my main in so many areas, has become a source of pride and an ongoing project that seems to evolve with every login.

## Large Overarching Goals

- **5kc in all bosses**: A testament to my PvM prowess and determination.
- **Meaningful PvM drops**: The lifeblood of progress, from Ahrims to the elusive blowpipe.
- **Base 90s or max**: Depending on how the winds of fortune blow and my current state of mind.

## The Path to Glory

The journey is split into two main paths: conquering bosses and mastering skills.

### Slayer and Bosses

The road to 5kc in all bosses is paved with countless battles, each more challenging than the last. My targets are not just any bosses but those that drop the gears and glories I seek: full barrows set, thread, prims, occult, and the coveted raids drops.

### Skill Mastery

The path to base 90s is a marathon, not a sprint, involving:

- **Combat skills**: Gained passively through slayer and PvM.
- **Prayer**: Boosted by moons, slayer, hunter, and mining.
- **Runecrafting and Construction**: Reaching for the stars with 95/99 and 99 respectively.
- **Hunter and Herblore**: For the fun of it and the practical benefits.

And the list goes on, from crafting to woodcutting, each skill a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal.

## Present Day

As of today, the focus is on herblore and agility, pushing towards those major breakpoints. Zulrah and Dagganoth Kings are in my sights for their precious drops. And once those are secured, it's a toss-up between hunting for the sheer joy of it, slaying for gains, or braving the wildy bosses for that thrill of danger.

The journey of an Ironman is never straightforward, filled with unexpected twists and turns, but that's what makes it so exhilarating. Every achievement, no matter how small, feels monumental. And as I look back at how far this account has come, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and an eager anticipation for what's to come.

The road ahead is long, but the rewards, both tangible and intangible, are what make every moment worth it. Here's to the next chapter in this Ironman saga, where the only certainty is the adventure itself.
