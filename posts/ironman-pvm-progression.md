# The Ironman PvM Progression Saga

In the world of Oldschool Runescape, where every item and achievement is earned through blood, sweat, and the occasional tears, my Ironman account stands as a testament to dedication and perhaps a sprinkle of madness. This account, a beacon of personal achievement, has not only surpassed my main in numerous aspects but has also set some ambitious goals that would make even the most seasoned players pause.

## The Grand Plan

The overarching goals for this account are as follows:

- **5kc in all bosses**: A testament to both skill and perseverance.
- **Meaningful PvM drops**: The lifeblood of any PvM-focused account, aiming for items like Ahrims, blowpipe, and the coveted full barrows set.
- **Base 90s or max**: Depending on how deep into the grind I'm willing to go, this could range from achieving base level 90s in all skills to the Herculean task of maxing every skill.

Currently, I find myself in the thick of the mid-game, with significant progress made and yet so much more to conquer. The path to achieving these lofty goals is twofold:

1. **Slayer and Bossing**: The bread and butter of any PvM'er, this will be my route to 5kc in all bosses.
2. **Skill Grinding**: A mix of combat and non-combat skills, focusing on those that will aid in PvM and overall account progression.

## The Journey So Far

The journey has been a mix of strategic planning and seizing opportunities as they come. Here's a breakdown of the current strategy:

- **Herblore and Agility**: Grinding these skills to their respective breakpoints for more efficient PvM and overall gameplay.
- **Zulrah**: The goal here is to farm for the magic seed, a crucial item for any serious PvMer.
- **Dagannoth Kings**: Hunting for the dragon axe, an essential tool for any skiller.

Once these immediate goals are met, the plan is to dive into Hunter for the sheer joy of it, or perhaps return to the Slayer grind or venture into the Wilderness for bosses.

## Looking Ahead

The road ahead is daunting, filled with potential pitfalls and high-stakes rewards. Yet, the thrill of the chase, the allure of those meaningful PvM drops, and the satisfaction of hitting those skill milestones keep me coming back. Whether it's grinding out levels in Herblore, taking on the might of Zulrah, or strategizing the next big boss kill, each step brings me closer to those overarching goals.

In the end, this account is more than just a collection of stats and items; it's a journey. A journey of highs and lows, of triumphs and setbacks. But above all, it's a testament to the enduring appeal of Oldschool Runescape and the endless possibilities it offers to those willing to put in the time and effort.

So here's to the grind, the glory, and the sheer insanity of it all. May the RNG gods be ever in our favor.
