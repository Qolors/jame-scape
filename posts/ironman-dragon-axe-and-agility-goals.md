# Ironman's Quest for the Dragon Axe and Agility Milestones

In the world of Oldschool Runescape, every item, every level, and every achievement tells a story. For an ironman, these stories are not just milestones; they're epic tales of self-sufficiency and determination. Today, I find myself at a crossroads, contemplating the pursuit of a seemingly modest yet significant item: the dragon axe.

## The Dragon Axe Dilemma

For my account, at this stage, acquiring the dragon axe represents a 5% increase in DPS. On the surface, it might not seem like a game-changer, but for an ironman, it's a beacon of progress. The dragon axe, once a highly coveted drop, now sits at a humble price of 30k. Its value in gold may have diminished, but its utility for an ironman is unparalleled. It's not just an axe; it's a key that unlocks the path to 99 woodcutting, firemaking, fletching, and construction.

## The Dagganoth Kings Challenge

The journey to the dragon axe leads me to the lair of the Dagganoth Kings. A strong PvMer would approach this challenge with three equipment swaps: a ranged set for the mager, a mage set for the meleer, and a melee set for the ranger. With the right gear and strategy, including tick flicking the correct prayer, one can navigate this battle with finesse. Yet, as I prepare, I can't help but reflect on the agility shortcut recently released.

## Agility: A Path to Efficiency

This new shortcut, requiring 85 agility, transforms a tedious 3-minute walk into a mere 30-second journey. It's a game-changer, prompting me to focus on agility training. Currently, I'm two hours away from reaching 82 agility. It's a slow grind, but each level unlocks new possibilities, like more of the Hallowed Sepulchre, which is not only fun but beneficial for my account.

## Marks of Grace and FashionScape

As I navigate the rooftops, collecting Marks of Grace, I'm faced with a decision. At around level 83, I can purchase the full graceful outfit again. But there's more. The Hallowed Sepulchre offers black dye, allowing me to transform my graceful outfit into a sleek, full black version. It's an added layer of goals, intertwining efficiency with aesthetics, on my journey to 85 agility.

## Conclusion

The pursuit of the dragon axe and the agility milestones are more than just objectives; they're chapters in my ironman saga. Each step, each decision, weaves into the larger narrative of my adventure in Oldschool Runescape. Whether it's strategizing for the Dagganoth Kings or plotting my agility training, every moment is a piece of the story I'm crafting, one of self-reliance, strategy, and the pursuit of goals that are uniquely meaningful to an ironman.
