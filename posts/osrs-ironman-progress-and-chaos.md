# OSRS Ironman Progress and Chaos

My Ironman account is an absolute beast, surpassing my main in ways I hadn't imagined possible. The thrill of this journey is unmatched, and my goals are as lofty as they are chaotic.

## The Grand Plan

My overarching goals are simple yet daunting:

- Achieve 5kc in all bosses
- Secure meaningful PvM drops
- Reach base 90s or max stats (mood-dependent, of course)

Currently, I'm navigating the treacherous waters of mid-game, with my sights set on Ahrims, blowpipe, a full barrows set, thread, prims, occult, and those elusive raids drops.

### The Path to Glory

The journey to 5kc in all bosses intertwines with my quest for meaningful PvM drops. This means a lot of slayer, learning boss mechanics, and diving into more barrows, Zulrah, and the Theatre of Blood.

As for achieving base 90s, the strategy is multifaceted:

- **Combats**: Level passively through slayer and PvM
- **Prayer**: Utilize moons, slayer, hunter, and mining
- **Runecrafting**: Aim for 95/99 for efficient slayer/prayer
- **Construction**: Reach 99, keeping it above prayer, and snag that outfit
- **Hunter**: Hit 99 at leisure, beneficial for herblore and prayer

The list goes on, with herblore, crafting, fletching, mining, smithing, fishing, cooking, firemaking, and woodcutting all part of the grand scheme.

## Present Day Chaos

Right now, it's all about hitting those major breakpoints in herblore and agility. I'm grinding Zulrah for that magic seed and tackling the Dagganoth Kings for the dragon axe.

Once those are out of the way, it's a toss-up between focusing on hunter for the sheer fun of it, slaying my way through the levels, or taking on the wildy bosses for that extra thrill.

The journey is chaotic, filled with ambitious goals and the random joy of achievement. It's a testament to the unpredictable, yet rewarding nature of playing an Ironman in OSRS.

Whether it's grinding for that next big drop, strategizing my next skill to level, or simply enjoying the madness of it all, this account has become a source of pride and a never-ending adventure.
