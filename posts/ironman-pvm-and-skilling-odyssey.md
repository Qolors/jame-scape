# Ironman PvM and Skilling Odyssey: A Journey Beyond the Main

My Ironman account has become an unexpected powerhouse, surpassing my main in more ways than I could have imagined. It's a thrilling, sometimes manic journey of setting and smashing through goals that seemed daunting at first glance. Here's a glimpse into the chaos and strategy of my Oldschool Runescape adventure.

## The Grand Plan

The overarching goals for my account are ambitious, to say the least:

- **5kc in all bosses**: A testament to my PvM prowess.
- **Meaningful PvM drops**: The loot that makes the grind worth it.
- **Base 90s or max**: Depending on how deep into the grind I'm willing to go.

Currently, I'm navigating the tumultuous waters of the mid-game, with my sights set on Ahrims, blowpipe, a full barrows set, and more. The path to glory is paved with Slayer tasks and boss fights, each victory bringing me closer to my PvM and skilling goals.

## The Path to PvM Mastery

The journey to 5kc in all bosses is intertwined with my quest for meaningful PvM drops. Each boss fight not only tests my skills but also brings the chance of securing another piece of my dream gear. From the depths of Barrows to the challenges of Zulrah and beyond, every drop is a step closer to my ultimate PvM setup.

## Skilling to the Extreme

Skilling on an Ironman is a different beast. My goals are lofty but clear:

- **Combat skills**: Leveled passively through Slayer and PvM.
- **Prayer**: Boosted through various means, including moons and Slayer.
- **Runecrafting and Construction**: Pushing towards 99 for efficiency and perks.
- **Hunter, Herblore, and more**: Each skill has its place in my strategy, contributing to my overall strength and self-sufficiency.

## Present Day: The Grind Continues

As of now, my focus shifts between Herblore and Agility, pushing towards those major breakpoints that will allow me to tackle higher-level content with ease. Zulrah and Dagganoth Kings are in my crosshairs, each offering key items that will propel me further along my journey.

The grind is relentless, but the rewards—both in loot and personal achievement—are unparalleled. Whether it's pushing for 99 Hunter for the sheer fun of it or diving into the Wilderness for boss fights, every session is a step towards my ultimate Oldschool Runescape goals.

The path ahead is fraught with challenges, but with each skill leveled and boss defeated, I'm writing my own legend in the annals of Ironman history. This account has become more than just a side project; it's a testament to the thrill of setting seemingly impossible goals and achieving them, one manic, random thought at a time.
