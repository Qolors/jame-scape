# The Ironman Journey: Goals, Grinds, and Glory

My Ironman account has become an absolute beast, surpassing my main in ways I never thought possible. It's a thrilling ride, filled with ambitious goals and the sweet taste of achievement. Here's a glimpse into the madness and method of my Oldschool Runescape Ironman journey.

## The Grand Plan

The overarching goals for my account are as follows:

- Achieve 5kc (kill count) in all bosses
- Secure meaningful PvM (Player vs Monster) drops
- Reach base 90s in all skills or max them out, depending on how deep into the grind I fall

Currently, I'm navigating the mid-game with precision, eyeing Ahrims, the blowpipe, a full barrows set, thread, prims, an occult necklace, and coveted raids drops as my PvM trophies.

### The Path to PvM Dominance

The journey to 5kc in all bosses intertwines with my quest for meaningful PvM drops. The strategy is simple yet challenging:

- **Slayer and Bossing**: The backbone of my PvM conquest.
- **Barrows, Zulrah, and ToA**: The arenas where I'll hunt for my prized drops.

## The Skill Grind

Achieving base 90s or maxing out depends on a mix of determination and, let's be honest, how much I'm willing to embrace the grind. Here's the breakdown:

- **Combat Skills**: Leveled passively through slayer and PvM.
- **Prayer**: Boosted by moons, slayer, hunter, and mining.
- **Runecrafting (95/99)**: A necessity for efficient slayer and prayer leveling.
- **Construction (99)**: To stay ahead of prayer and secure the outfit.
- **Hunter (99)**: A leisurely pursuit beneficial for herblore and prayer.
- **Herblore (90+)**: Fueled by farming and PvM drops.
- **Crafting, Fletching, Mining, Smithing, Fishing, Cooking, Firemaking, Woodcutting**: Each with its own strategy, but all integral to the grand scheme.

## Present Day

As of now, the focus is on herblore and agility until I hit the major breakpoints. Zulrah is on my hit list until I snag the magic seed, and the Dagganoth Kings better watch out until I secure the dragon axe.

Once those goals are met, it's a toss-up between hunting for the sheer joy of it, slaying my way through the ranks, or taking on the wildy bosses for that extra thrill.

The journey of an Ironman is a testament to patience, strategy, and a bit of madness. But as I look at my account, I can't help but feel a sense of pride. It's not just about the goals; it's about the journey, the ups and downs, and the stories that come with each achievement. Here's to the next chapter in this wild adventure.
