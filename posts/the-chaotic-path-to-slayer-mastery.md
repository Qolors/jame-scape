# The Chaotic Path to Slayer Mastery

For I am a farming man, an agility enthusiast, and a Runescape player, signing up for some truly messed up stuff. But isn't that the beauty of it all? Maybe it's cringe enough to be sarcastic? Yes. Alright. New post. Kinda. This is all finished. This has been on my radar since then.

Let’s hyper focus into the following: **Slayer**. What makes efficient slayer? A very subjective question with some objective milestones.

- **Quest cape**: done (saves inventory spot for dramen staff)
- **Karamja elite diary**: teles to duradel (time save if only doing duradel tasks)
- **Wrath runes**:
  - makes prayer 1:1 with slayer
  - requires 95 runecrafting or boost
  - benefits greatly from divine rune pouch (from ToA)
  - wrath runes are also a pain point in terms of how to get the wrath talisman. (GOTR or Vorkath)(GOTR is the better long term answer)
- **Rejuvenation Pool**: full heals
- **Berserker ring**( ideal for melee tasks) - requires 85 agility
- **Bandos tasset/blood moon tassets** (ideal for melee tasks)

At that point, the account is perfectly set to do slayer to 99. Further we can prepare for boss slayer. But nah. It’s really not the most wild to-do list in order to prepare for end game slayer.

I’m prioritizing:

- **Agility**
- **Herblore**

Then maybe runecrafting maybe maybe. Both are very good for the account.

Also let’s start thinking about deadman mode. I don’t know why. But I think I will play it this year. Will do a woodcutting+hunter only run and see how it goes. Cringe and embarrassing.

The wrath rune is the key to solving erectole dysfunction.
