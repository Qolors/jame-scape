# The Chaotic Path to Mastery: Boss Kills and Skill Peaks

![Ironman PvM Progression Guide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141540362188505181/1242152196053925900/image1.jpg?ex=664ccbe1&is=664b7a61&hm=cba926d192eafa7066d6d99bb29d0af977ebaf7bb06c4936bf5b2a49799456c0&)

The journey of an Oldschool Runescape player is often a tale of ambition, strategy, and sometimes, sheer madness. My account, a testament to countless hours of grinding, has now surpassed my main in ways I couldn't have imagined. The goals? Seemingly straightforward but daunting in their own right:

- **5kc in all bosses**
- **Meaningful PvM drops**
- **Base 90s or max** (mood-dependent, of course)

Currently, I find myself in the thick of the mid-game, armed with a checklist that reads like a PvM enthusiast's dream: Ahrims, blowpipe, full barrows set, thread, prims, occult, and those elusive raids drops. The path to these treasures? A mix of Slayer tasks, boss battles, and a sprinkle of luck.

## The Grind Begins

The strategy is simple yet complex, a dichotomy that only true Runescapers would understand. **Slayer** tasks and boss battles pave the way to the coveted **5kc** in all bosses, while the pursuit of **meaningful PvM drops** demands dedication to barrows, Zulrah, and the Theatre of Blood, among others.

But what of the skills? The path to **base 90s** is a winding one, with each skill offering its own unique challenges:

- **Combat skills** grow passively through Slayer and PvM.
- **Prayer** benefits from bones, Slayer tasks, and the occasional mining expedition.
- **Runecrafting** and **Construction** demand both dedication and a hefty amount of resources.
- **Hunter**, **Herblore**, **Crafting**, **Fletching**, **Mining**, **Smithing**, **Fishing**, **Cooking**, **Firemaking**, and **Woodcutting** each have their own milestones and methods, from the Giants' Foundry to the chilly embrace of Wintertodt.

## Present Day Chaos

As of now, the focus shifts between **Herblore** and **Agility**, grinding until those major breakpoints are hit. The elusive **magic seed** from Zulrah and the **dragon axe** from Dagganoth Kings are just the beginning. Once these are secured, the world opens up: Hunter to 99 for the sheer joy of it, more Slayer tasks, or perhaps a foray into the Wilderness for those wildy bosses.

The journey is chaotic, filled with highs and lows, but the end goal remains clear: mastery over bosses and skills alike. Whether it's grinding for that next big drop or strategizing the most efficient path to 99, the adventure is in the chaos. And in Oldschool Runescape, chaos is just part of the game.
