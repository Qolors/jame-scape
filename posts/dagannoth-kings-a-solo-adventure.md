# Dagannoth Kings: A Solo Adventure

Testing, testing, 1 2 3... We are online! Let's dive into an adventure that feels more like a rite of passage for every Oldschool Runescape player: tackling the Dagannoth Kings solo. It's a tale of preparation, perseverance, and a bit of insanity. Why insanity, you ask? Well, let's break it down.

## The Journey Begins

First off, the Dagannoth Kings are often seen as some of the easiest boss fights in the game—if you do them correctly. They're like baby's first steps into Player vs Monster (PvM). But here's the kicker: the real challenge isn't the kings themselves; it's getting to them. Imagine having to teleport to a place notorious for having no close teleports. Sure, you could build a house teleport, but where's the fun in that?

Then, you embark on a marathon through a horde of dagannoths, armed with nothing but your wits, a rune thrownaxe, and a pet rock. Yes, you read that right—a pet rock and a thrownaxe are your VIP tickets to this boss fight. Without them, you might as well turn back.

## The Gauntlet

After what feels like an eternity of running, dodging, and climbing ladders (up and down, then up and down again, making sure not to make a wrong turn), you find yourself in a cavern. At this point, you've probably chugged a stamina potion, and two of your inventory spaces are occupied by that damn rock and thrownaxe, which, by the way, have no use anywhere else in the game.

## The Boss Fight

Three minutes and countless obstacles later, you're finally at the boss fight. You descend the ladder into a room with the three kings, each wielding a specific attack style. If two decide to tag-team you, it's game over, man. You're likely in range of the mage king, who can hit 50s, and the range king, known for his accuracy though with a lower max hit. The melee king? You can almost always ignore him, freeze him, or find a safespot.

So, why is this boss considered "baby's first PvM"? If you manage to enter the cave without getting tagged by the mage and rangers, you can safespot and kill the melee king on repeat. And here's the cherry on top: the melee king drops a ring that gives you 2 max hits, which, early in the game, is easily a 10% increase in DPS.

In conclusion, the Dagannoth Kings might seem daunting at first, but with the right preparation and a bit of luck, they can be a rewarding solo adventure. Just remember to bring your pet rock and rune thrownaxe; you wouldn't want to get all the way there only to be turned away at the door.
