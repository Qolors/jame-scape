# Chaotic Deadman Mode Strategy and the Art of Multitasking

Alright, let's get this straight. My approach to Oldschool Runescape's Deadman Mode is, well, a bit all over the place. But amidst the chaos, there's a method to the madness. Let's dive into the manic strategy that's been brewing in my mind.

## Deadman Mode Plan

This isn't your average game plan. We're talking about a strategy that involves a mix of precision and, dare I say, a dash of recklessness. Here's the breakdown for the Lvl 50 combat bracket:

- **Attack**:
  - 40: Rune scimitar
  - 42: Void
  - 50: Granite maul
  - 60: Dragon dagger (DDS), Dragon scimitar (DScim), Dragon claws

- **Prayer**:
  - 13: Superhuman strength
  - 31: Ultimate strength

- **Defence**:
  - 13: Adamant gloves

Yes, you read that right. The plan involves gearing up with some serious hardware and leveraging my stats for maximum efficiency. And let's not forget the Deadman mode's bread and butter: the DDS with a 12+12 max hit at 30 strength. Laughable to some, but deadly in the right hands.

## The Hunter Spam Strategy

My Deadman plan takes a weird turn here. I'm going all in on hunter spam for full mixed hide, glory, and dragonhide vambraces. The goal? Good GP and the best in slot hybrid range/melee gear for the lvl 3-50 combat bracket. It's a bold move, but one that could pay off handsomely.

## The AFK Grind

With OSRS set to become a lot more AFK for me, I'm eyeing blood runes to 94-95. Why, you ask? Because I plan to enjoy Diablo 4 without pause. That's right, I'm multitasking like a boss, setting up my inventory specifically for AFK activities that benefit my account while I dive into Diablo 4.

## Pre-Slay Goals

Before I even think about slaying, here are my goals:

- 85 Agility
- 95 Runecrafting
- 87 Herblore
- 89 Magic
- 99 Hunter

I need the graceful top, cape, and gloves, which means I'm currently on the hunt for 45 more marks.

## Inventory Management

With 3 more slots in my looting bag and 16 items in the deathbank (collapsible to 11), my inventory management is key. It's all about compressing and optimizing to make room for the essentials.

## Final Thoughts

This plan might seem chaotic to some, but there's a method to the madness. By balancing my time between OSRS and Diablo 4, I'm maximizing my gaming efficiency. It's a wild ride, but one I'm fully committed to. Wish me luck!
